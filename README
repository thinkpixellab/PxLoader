PxLoader is a Javascript library that helps you download images, sound files or anything else you need before you take a specific action on your site (like showing a user interface or starting a game). You can use it to create a preloader for HTML5 games and websites.

AMD
---
For people using asynchronous module definitions like RequireJS, AMD-ified modules have been included.  Please see the dependency list in pxloader.js and match the paths to the config in your project.  For Image/Sound/Video, it's just a matter of uncommenting in the dependency list.
